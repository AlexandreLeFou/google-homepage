The aim of this project was to replicate the Google Homepage in order to practice my HTML/CSS skills as well as have a little bit of fun coding :)



P.S. this is an exercise from The Odin Project, an open source online platform that aims to provide a complete path for students to go from zero to employed as web developers while working with other students along the way.
